  <h1>DIVERGE</h1>
  <h3>Two Paths. One Life.</h3>
  <p>In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Chris Towne struggles to provide for his wife Anna, who has been infected with a deadly virus. When a mysterious survivor crosses paths with them, he offers Chris food and water, but only if heâ€™ll leave his sick wife behind.  Chris refuses and continues to search for ways to cure his wife.</p> 
  <p>Later while scavenging for supplies, Chris is ambushed and knocked unconscious. He awakens to find himself in present-day, pre-apocalypse New York City, disoriented, with a strange scar on his leg.</p>
  <p>As Chris struggles to understand what has happened, he sees a familiar face in the crowd. It is Anna, but she is healthy, vibrant, and with another man: a past version of himself. Now the only person standing in the way of the life he used to have is the man he used to be.</p> 
  <p>What would you sacrifice to reclaim what was taken from you and would you lose yourself in doing so?</p>
  <h3>About the film</h3>
  <p>DIVERGE is the first production from Brooklyn based production house, Young Gunner Films, one of eight teams chosen from a pool of over two hundred to participate in the inaugural Dogfish Accelerator - the first incubator program for independent film companies.</p>
  <p>Produced in conjunction with Gentile Entertainment Group and Easy Open Productions, DIVERGE was shot over the course of a year to account for significant seasonal changes, the need to replicate shots with our lead actor in two distinct timelines, as well as location availabilities and production resources.</p>
  <p>Produced firmly under the mantra of: fast, cheap, and good - pick two (we chose the latter two), DIVERGE is the product of the efforts of a dedicated and resourceful team of NY based collaborators both above and below the line.
  </p>
  <p>  The filmmakers wrapped principal photography in the spring of 2015 and have since brought on a series of incredible post-production collaborators including The Blair Brothers, Company 3, and Jeremy Cox. A work-in-progress version of the film took the Top Prize at the prestigious US in Progress sidebar competition at the Champs Elysees Film Festival. 
  </p>
  <p>  The finished film will premiere in the late winter or early spring of 2016. Please sign up for our email list and follow us on social media for updates.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>The Diverge Team</p>
