      <h1>DIVERGE</h1>
      <h3>One Life. Two Paths.</h3>
      <p>In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Chris Towne struggles to provide for his wife Anna, who has been infected with a deadly virus. When a mysterious survivor crosses paths with them, he offers Chris food and water, but only if heâ€™ll leave his sick wife behind.  Chris refuses and continues to search for ways to cure his wife.</p> 
      <p>Later while scavenging for supplies, Chris is ambushed and knocked unconscious. He awakens to find himself in present-day, pre-apocalypse New York City, disoriented, with a strange scar on his leg.</p>
      <p>As Chris struggles to understand what has happened, he sees a familiar face in the crowd. It is Anna, but she is healthy, vibrant, and with another man: a past version of himself. Now the only person standing in the way of the life he used to have is the man he used to be.</p> 
      <p>What would you sacrifice to reclaim what was taken from you and would you lose yourself in doing so?</p>
