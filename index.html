    <h1>DIVERGE</h1>
    <p>a film by James Morrison</p>
    <p>DIVERGE is the first production from Brooklyn based production house, Young Gunner Films, one of eight teams chosen from a pool of over two hundred to participate in the inaugural Dogfish Accelerator - the first incubator program for independent film companies.</p>
    <p>Produced in conjunction with Gentile Entertainment Group and Easy Open Productions, DIVERGE was shot over the course of a year to account for significant seasonal changes, the need to replicate shots with our lead actor in two distinct timelines, as well as location availabilities and production resources.</p>
    <p>Produced firmly under the mantra of: fast, cheap, and good - pick two (we chose the latter two), DIVERGE is the product of the efforts of a dedicated and resourceful team of NY based collaborators both above and below the line.
    </p>
    <p>  The filmmakers wrapped principal photography in the spring of 2015 and have since brought on a series of incredible post-production collaborators including The Blair Brothers, Company 3, and Jeremy Cox. A work-in-progress version of the film took the Top Prize at the prestigious US in Progress sidebar competition at the Champs Elysees Film Festival. 
    </p>
    <p>  The finished film will premiere in the late winter or early spring of 2016. Please sign up for our email list and follow us on social media for updates.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>The Diverge Team</p>
